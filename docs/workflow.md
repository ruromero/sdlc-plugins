**Jira state transitions:** New → In Progress (implement-task) → In Review (implement-task) → Done (human merge)

## Prerequisite: Setup

**Skill:** `/sdlc-workflow:setup`

Configures a project's CLAUDE.md with the required `# Project Configuration` section. This is a one-time prerequisite for all other skills — plan-feature, implement-task, and verify-pr all validate Project Configuration before executing and will stop if it is missing.

**Invocation:**

```
/sdlc-workflow:setup
```

The setup skill is idempotent — running it multiple times on an already-configured project produces no changes. See [docs/project-config-contract.md](project-config-contract.md) for the required configuration structure.

---

## Execution Phases

The workflow follows four phases: **Define**, **Plan**, **Implement**, and **Verify**.

### Define Phase

**Skill:** `/sdlc-workflow:define-feature`

Interactively walks the user through all Feature description template sections and creates a fully-described Feature issue in Jira.

**Invocation:**

```
/sdlc-workflow:define-feature
/sdlc-workflow:define-feature My Feature Title
```

**Workflow:**
1. Validate Project Configuration in CLAUDE.md
2. Present a roadmap of the 9 template sections
3. Collect Feature summary (title)
4. Walk through each section interactively (with skip support)
5. Offer self-assignment
6. Preview the full description and collect approval
7. Create the Feature issue in Jira (labeled `ai-generated-jira`)
8. Post a summary comment and suggest `/plan-feature` as the next step

**Output:**
- Feature issue created in Jira with a structured description
- Summary comment on the created issue

**Guardrails:**
- Jira-only — no filesystem modifications permitted
- All description content must come from user input — no fabrication
- Issue is never created without user preview and approval

---

### Plan Phase

**Skill:** `/sdlc-workflow:plan-feature`

Converts a Jira feature into structured implementation tasks.

**Inputs:**
- Jira feature issue ID (required)
- Figma design URL (optional)

**Invocation:**

```
/sdlc-workflow:plan-feature PROJ-123
/sdlc-workflow:plan-feature PROJ-123 https://www.figma.com/design/abc123/MyDesign
```

**Workflow:**
1. Validate Project Configuration in CLAUDE.md
2. Fetch feature from Jira
3. Retrieve Figma mockups (if available)
4. Analyze repositories using Serena or fallback tools
5. Build a Repository Impact Map
6. Generate structured Jira tasks with dependencies

**Output:**
- Implementation tasks created in Jira (labeled `ai-generated-jira`)
- Impact map comment on the feature issue
- Issue links (feature incorporates tasks, task dependency chains)

**Guardrails:**
- Planning-only — no file modifications permitted
- All output goes to Jira, never to the filesystem

---

### Implement Phase

**Skill:** `/sdlc-workflow:implement-task`

Takes a structured Jira task and implements it: modifies code, runs tests, commits, opens a PR, and updates Jira.

**Invocation:**

```
/sdlc-workflow:implement-task PROJ-231
```

**Workflow:**
1. Validate Project Configuration in CLAUDE.md
2. Fetch and parse the Jira task description
3. Verify dependencies are Done
4. Transition task to In Progress and assign to current user
5. Inspect code using Serena or fallback tools
6. Create feature branch (named after the Jira issue ID)
7. Implement changes scoped to the task
8. Write and run tests
9. Verify acceptance criteria
10. Self-verify scope containment and sensitive patterns
11. Commit (Conventional Commits, Jira ID in footer, assisted-by trailer)
12. Push branch and open PR
13. Update Jira (PR link, comment, transition to In Review)

**Guardrails:**
- Changes scoped to files listed in the task — no unrelated refactoring
- Code must be inspected before modification
- Incomplete descriptions require user clarification, not improvisation

---

### Verify Phase

**Skill:** `/sdlc-workflow:verify-pr`

Verifies a pull request against its originating Jira task's acceptance criteria and deterministic guardrails. The skill operates on local code for acceptance criteria verification, so it conditionally checks out the PR branch before inspecting files.

**Use cases:**

- **Author self-verification** — the contributor who ran `/implement-task` already has the PR branch checked out locally. The skill detects this and proceeds without a checkout.
- **Reviewer/CI audit** — another person or a headless CI job runs `/verify-pr` from an arbitrary branch. The skill detects the branch mismatch and checks out the PR branch automatically.

**Inputs:**
- Jira task issue ID with an associated PR (required)

**Invocation:**

```
/sdlc-workflow:verify-pr PROJ-231
```

**Workflow:**
1. Validate Project Configuration in CLAUDE.md
2. Fetch and parse the Jira task description
3. Identify the PR from the Jira custom field
4. Checkout the PR branch if not already on it
5. Review feedback resolution — read PR reviews, create sub-tasks for code change requests
6. Root-cause investigation — trace defects through the full workflow chain
7. Scope containment — compare changed files against the task
8. Diff size check
9. Commit traceability — verify Jira ID in commit messages
10. Sensitive pattern scan
11. CI status check
12. Acceptance criteria verification using local code inspection
13. Verification commands (if specified in the task)
14. Generate and post verification report to GitHub PR and Jira

**Output:**
- Verification report posted to both GitHub PR (as a PR comment) and Jira (as an issue comment)
- Review feedback sub-tasks created in Jira (with "Blocks" links and `review-feedback` label)
- Root-cause improvement tasks created in Jira (with `root-cause` label)
- No merge action taken
- No Jira status transition

**Guardrails:**
- Verification-only — does not modify code, merge the PR, or transition the Jira issue
- Criteria come from the Jira task description, not from reading the diff
- Report is informational — a human reviewer decides whether to merge
- Sub-tasks and root-cause tasks are informational — they track required fixes and systemic improvements but do not block verification

> **Design intent:** This workflow builds the foundation for safe auto-merge. Jira
> becomes the source of truth via blocking sub-tasks: once proven reliable, a future
> enhancement adds a merge decision step where verify-pr checks that all blocking
> sub-tasks are Done + all verification checks PASS + CI passes, then auto-merges.
> Auto-merge itself is out of scope for now — but every design decision aligns with
> this end state.

## Jira Task Structure

Tasks generated by `plan-feature` follow a structured template with these sections:

| Section | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Repository | Yes | Single repository per task |
| Description | Yes | What the task achieves and why |
| Files to Modify | No | Existing files to change, with reasons |
| Files to Create | No | New files to add, with purpose |
| API Changes | No | Endpoints to create or modify |
| Implementation Notes | No | Patterns to follow, code references |
| Acceptance Criteria | Yes | Pass/fail checklist |
| Test Requirements | Yes | Tests to write or update |
| Verification Commands | No | Commands to verify acceptance criteria |
| Target PR | No | Existing PR URL for review feedback fixes |
| Review Context | No | Original review comment that triggered the task |
| Dependencies | No | Prerequisite tasks |

Sections that do not apply are omitted (not left empty). File paths and implementation notes reference real code discovered during repository analysis.
