# Architectural Constraints

Deterministic, verifiable rules that all SDLC workflow skills must follow.
Every rule is pass/fail — not subjective. Each rule traces back to an
existing instruction in a SKILL.md or CLAUDE.md file.

## 1. Skill Scope Rules

| # | Constraint | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | `plan-feature` MUST NOT modify, create, or delete any source code files in any repository. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Guardrails |
| 1.2 | `plan-feature` MUST NOT use Edit, Write, or Bash tools to change files. Only read-only tools (Read, Glob, Grep, Serena search) are permitted. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Guardrails |
| 1.3 | `plan-feature` output goes to Jira (tasks, comments) — never to the filesystem. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Guardrails |
| 1.4 | `implement-task` MUST keep changes scoped to what the task describes — no unrelated refactoring. | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Important Rules |
| 1.5 | `implement-task` MUST NOT guess code structure — it must inspect code before modifying it using Serena or Read/Grep/Glob. | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Important Rules |
| 1.6 | `implement-task` MUST ask the user for clarification and stop execution when the structured description is incomplete — it MUST NOT draft an implementation plan or proceed with any subsequent steps until the user responds. | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Important Rules, Step 1 |
| 1.7 | `define-feature` MUST NOT modify, create, or delete any files in any repository. Only Jira MCP tools are permitted for output. | `define-feature/SKILL.md` — Guardrails |

| 1.16 | `verify-pr` MUST flag repetitive test functions that could be parameterized as a WARN finding, applying the Meszaros heuristic as the decision boundary. | `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 2 (style-conventions sub-agent) |
| 1.17 | `verify-pr` MUST flag test functions missing doc comments as a WARN finding. | `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 3 (style-conventions sub-agent) |
| 1.18 | `verify-pr` test change classification sub-agent MUST operate in complete isolation — it MUST NOT receive or access the Jira task description, review comments, PR metadata, or outputs from other verify-pr steps. | `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 4, Step 4b (style-conventions sub-agent) |
| 1.19 | `verify-pr` MUST classify REDUCTIVE and MIXED test changes as WARN (advisory). Test Change Classification MUST NOT elevate the overall result to FAIL. | `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 4, Verdict (style-conventions sub-agent); `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Step 14 (orchestrator) |
| 1.20 | `verify-pr` MUST classify new test files (not on base branch) as additive without sub-agent analysis. | `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 4, Step 4a (style-conventions sub-agent) |
| 1.21 | `verify-pr` test change classification semantic assessment MUST override structural signals when they disagree. | `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 4, Step 4d (style-conventions sub-agent) |
| 1.22 | `verify-pr` domain sub-agents MUST NOT perform Jira mutations (create sub-tasks, post comments, transition issues). | `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Important Rules (orchestrator); `verify-pr/intent-alignment.md`, `security.md`, `correctness.md`, `style-conventions.md` — Constraints |

| 1.24 | `verify-pr` domain sub-agents MUST return responses using the structured finding template (`finding-template.md`). | `verify-pr/intent-alignment.md`, `security.md`, `correctness.md`, `style-conventions.md` — Output Format |
| 1.25 | `verify-pr` orchestrator MUST dispatch domain sub-agents in parallel. | `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Step 4d (Dispatch), Important Rules (orchestrator) |
| 1.26 | `verify-pr` root-cause investigation MUST receive aggregated findings from all domain sub-agents with source attribution. | `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Step 5 (orchestrator), Important Rules |
| 1.27 | `plan-feature` MUST determine the workflow mode (`direct-to-main` or `feature-branch`) during planning and record the decision on the feature issue. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Step 4.5 (Determine Workflow Mode) |
| 1.28 | `verify-pr` MUST detect eval result reviews in PR conversations by matching all three criteria: author is `github-actions[bot]`, body contains `## Eval Results` marker, and body contains `sdlc-workflow/run-evals` footer. | `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Step 4a.1 |
| 1.29 | `verify-pr` eval result detection MUST NOT produce false positives — non-eval reviews (human reviews, other bot comments) MUST NOT be identified as eval results. | `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Step 4a.1 (NFR 2) |
| 1.30 | `verify-pr` Test Quality verdict MUST incorporate eval results: PASS when all evals pass and no traditional test issues, WARN when any eval assertions fail, N/A only when neither traditional tests nor eval results are present. | `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Step 6a; `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 5 |

| 1.32 | `verify-pr` eval failure sub-tasks MUST enter the existing root-cause investigation pipeline (Step 7). | `verify-pr/SKILL.md` — Step 7 |
| 1.33 | `plan-feature` MUST post a description digest comment after creating each task per `shared/description-digest-protocol.md`. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Step 6a |
| 1.34 | `implement-task` MUST verify the description digest before proceeding and pause if a mismatch is detected. | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Step 1.5 |
| 1.35 | `implement-task` MUST skip digest verification with a warning when no digest comment exists (backward compatibility). | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Step 1.5 |
| 1.36 | `verify-pr` convention upgrade MUST validate convention file-type applicability per `shared/convention-applicability-rules.md` before upgrading a suggestion. | `verify-pr/style-conventions.md` — Check 1 |

| 1.46 | `triage-security` remediation tasks MUST follow the task-description-template.md format. | `triage-security/SKILL.md` — Important Rules §9, Remediation Task Creation |
| 1.47 | `triage-security` output goes to Jira only, with one exception: it may write to `security-matrix.md` in Konflux release repos for supportability matrix population. | `triage-security/SKILL.md` — Guardrails, Step 2.1 |
| 1.48 | `triage-security` MUST read ecosystems, lock file paths, and check commands from security-matrix.md Ecosystem Mappings — MUST NOT hardcode language-specific logic. | `triage-security/SKILL.md` — Step 1 (Ecosystem detection), Step 2.3 |
| 1.49 | `triage-security` MUST read the Component label pattern from Security Configuration — MUST NOT hardcode label prefixes. | `triage-security/SKILL.md` — Step 0, Step 1 (Data Extraction) |

### Prior Art — Cross-phase integrity (§1.33–1.35)

> Implements the zero-trust inter-agent principle from fullsend's [security-threat-model.md §Zero Trust Between Agents](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/blob/7f9cea122112e630eb9a40763c462a2c83b98543/docs/problems/security-threat-model.md#L201-L230) as a content-level detection mechanism. Fullsend handles stale workflow state preventively (clearing labels between phases — [architecture.md §Stale State Clearing](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/blob/7f9cea122112e630eb9a40763c462a2c83b98543/docs/architecture.md#L266)); this constraint addresses stale data content detectively (comparing hashes). The temporal split-payload attack pattern ([security-threat-model.md §Temporal Split-Payload](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/blob/7f9cea122112e630eb9a40763c462a2c83b98543/docs/problems/security-threat-model.md#L232-L296)) further motivates cross-phase integrity verification.

### Prior Art — Convention applicability (§1.36)

> Net-new; no fullsend counterpart. Fullsend's closest concept — independent tier classification by review agents ([intent-representation.md §Independent Tier Classification](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/blob/7f9cea122112e630eb9a40763c462a2c83b98543/docs/problems/intent-representation.md#L251)) — addresses scope assessment, not file-type applicability of convention guidance. This constraint addresses a gap specific to sdlc-plugins' CONVENTIONS.md-driven convention application.

## 2. Commit Rules

| # | Constraint | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Every commit MUST reference a Jira issue ID in the footer (e.g., `Implements TC-123`). | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Step 9; `methodology.md` — Traceable Implementation |
| 2.2 | Commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commits specification (`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`). | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Step 9 |
| 2.3 | Every commit MUST include `--trailer="Assisted-by: Claude Code"` to attribute AI assistance. | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Step 9 |

---

## 3. PR Rules

| 3.3 | `gh pr create` MUST always specify `--base <target-branch>` matching the task's Target Branch value. | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Step 10 (Default flow) |
| 3.4 | Feature branches MUST be named after the feature issue ID (e.g., `TC-4418`), not the task issue ID. | `implement-task/SKILL.md` — Step 5 (Create-branch bookend flow); `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Step 5 (Bookend task generation) |

---

| 4.2 | Every generated task description MUST include a **Description** section. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Task Description Template |
| 4.3 | Every generated task description MUST include an **Acceptance Criteria** section. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Task Description Template |
| 4.4 | Every generated task description MUST include a **Test Requirements** section. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Task Description Template |

| 4.8 | Every task created in Jira MUST include the `ai-generated-jira` label. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Step 6a |
| 4.9 | Tasks that change public APIs, configuration, setup steps, or architectural patterns SHOULD include an optional **Documentation Updates** section listing which docs need updating and what content to add or revise. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Template rules |
| 4.10 | Tasks SHOULD include a **Reuse Candidates** section when overlapping code (domain logic, components, utilities, or patterns) was found during repository analysis, listing file paths, symbol names, and relevance descriptions. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Task Description Template |
| 4.11 | When a task's scope matches a convention from CONVENTIONS.md (e.g., migrations with FK columns requiring indexes), the Implementation Notes MUST include explicit guidance referencing the convention by section name with a concrete example file. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Step 5 (Convention-aware task enrichment) |
| 4.12 | Every generated task description MUST include a **Target Branch** section. The value is `main` for direct-to-main mode, or the feature issue ID for feature-branch mode intermediate tasks. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Step 5 (Target Branch assignment); `task-description-template.md` — Rules |
| 4.13 | `plan-feature` convention-aware enrichment MUST validate convention file-type applicability per `shared/convention-applicability-rules.md` before including a convention in Implementation Notes. | `plan-feature/SKILL.md` — Step 5 |

### Prior Art — Convention applicability (§4.13)

> Net-new; no fullsend counterpart. Fullsend's closest concept — independent tier classification by review agents ([intent-representation.md §Independent Tier Classification](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/blob/7f9cea122112e630eb9a40763c462a2c83b98543/docs/problems/intent-representation.md#L251)) — addresses scope assessment, not file-type applicability of convention guidance. This constraint addresses a gap specific to sdlc-plugins' CONVENTIONS.md-driven convention application.
