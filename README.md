# sdlc-plugins

A Claude Code plugin marketplace for AI-assisted SDLC workflow skills.

This repository hosts reusable skills that help engineers set up projects,
plan features, implement tasks, and verify pull requests with full Jira
traceability. Any project can install these skills via Claude Code's plugin
system.

## Available Plugins

### sdlc-workflow

AI-assisted SDLC workflow skills for setting up projects, planning features,
implementing tasks, and verifying pull requests:

- **setup** — Set up or update the Project Configuration in your CLAUDE.md for
  use with sdlc-workflow skills.

- **plan-feature** — Convert a Jira feature into an implementation plan with
  structured Jira tasks. Analyzes repositories using Serena LSP, builds an
  impact map, and creates linked Jira tasks.

- **implement-task** — Implement a Jira task by reading its structured
  description, modifying code, running tests, committing, opening a PR, and
  updating Jira.

- **verify-pr** — Verify a PR against its Jira task's acceptance criteria and
  deterministic guardrails.

## Installation

### 1. Add the marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add mrizzi/sdlc-plugins
```

### 2. Install the plugin

```
/plugin install sdlc-workflow
```

This copies the plugin's skills into your project, making them available as
slash commands.

### 3. Configure your project

```
/sdlc-workflow:setup
```

This interactively populates the required Project Configuration in your
project's CLAUDE.md (repository registry, Jira settings, and code intelligence).

## Project Configuration

For the skills to work with your project, your project's CLAUDE.md must
implement the [Project Configuration Contract](docs/project-config-contract.md).

The contract requires three sections in your CLAUDE.md:

1. **Repository Registry** — maps repos to Serena instances and local paths
2. **Jira Configuration** — project key, cloud ID, issue type IDs
3. **Code Intelligence** — Serena tool naming and per-instance limitations

See [docs/project-config-contract.md](docs/project-config-contract.md) for
the full specification and a complete example.
